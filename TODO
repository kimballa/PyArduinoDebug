ARMv7 arch ref manual: pg C1-752 - a BKPT in an IRQ w/ higher priority than debugmon will
trigger a HardFault.

* Implement a HardFault handler that logs the IRQ BKPT $PC and set the MON_PEND bit to
  go to DebugMon after the IRQ is finished. Document this "delayed breakpoint" behavior.

  A consequence is that we cannot single-step (or inspect state while halted) within IRQs.

* FPB breakpoints may be ignored or HardFaulted; impl.defined. Test. Document.

* Add a 'skinny breakpoints' #define macro in dbg.h that just converts `BREAK()` to `__BKPT()`.
